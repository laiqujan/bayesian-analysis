# Bayesian Data Analysis of Invalid Bug Reports
## The data and the problem
### Case: 
In large-scale software development, many bug reports are submitted daily. However, not all of the submitted bug reports describe actual deviations in the system behavior, i.e., they are invalid. Invalid bug reports cost resources and time and make prioritization of valid bug reports difficult.

### Aim: 
This project explores the causal effects of different factors/variables on bug report resolutions (i.e., valid (1) or invalid (0)), such as submitter validity rate, total bug reports submitted, testing level where bug reports are caught and bug report quality or completeness.
 
### Dataset: We will use open-source and closed-source data sets.
